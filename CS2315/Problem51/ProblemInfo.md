## Problem 51 (Monte-Carlo Simulation)

This problem consists of running the Monte-Carlo simulation `X` many times unitl both arrays `xs1[]` and `xs2[]` were equal to one another for calculation

The tasks needed to be done were to complete `AreEQ`, `Factorial` and `XInXs`.

1. `AreEQ` was achieved by merely making *status* in the function True unless the values within `xs1[]` and `xs2[]` were not equal to one another.

2. `Factorial` was achieved by calculating the factorial given a `n` value and multiplying it by the existing value (1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n).

3. `XInXs` was achieved by comparing if the random value given by `RandomlyFillWithoutReplacement` wasn't in the array passed on to by the function.
